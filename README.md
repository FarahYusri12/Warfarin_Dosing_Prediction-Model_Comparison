# Warfarin Dosing Prediction â€“ Model Comparison

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project explores machine learning models for predicting warfarin dose.  
Prediction is based on genetic factors (CYP2C9, VKORC1) and clinical variables (age, weight, gender).

## Models to Compare
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Ridge Regression  
- Gradient Boosting

## TODO
- [ ] Data preprocessing  
- [ ] Train baseline models  
- [ ] Evaluate performance  
- [ ] Visualize results
